- 👋 Hi, I’m @saldegracia
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at coding and work on a couple of personal projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really...I think I need to improve first :)
- 📫 How to reach me ...isn't there a direct messaging system here or something?
